# internet_speed_complaints

This program is a simple script that will complain to xfinity on twitter when
my speeds are not anywhere close to what I'm paying for. I modified it for my raspberry pi using chromium and set it on a cron job for the times I am most likely to be at home using the internet.

Requirements:

1. Selenium
2. config.py file for twitter login (I could've used twitter api and tweepy to do this but was practicing using selenium for my class)
